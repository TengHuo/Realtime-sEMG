# CapgMyo sEMG data set

Data set [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aEy2_5O4j7J7ls26EWdj95PGWBwr2hzK?usp=sharing)

This folder contains three data sets for CapgMyo data. All data sets come from [zju-capg.org](http://zju-capg.org/myo/). Since the original web page was no longer accessible, I uploaded this data set to Google Drive.The data of CapgMyo-dba can also be downloaded from this website, [CapgMyo dba](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_from_Gesture_Recognition_by_Instantaneous_Surface_EMG_Images_CapgMyo-DBa/7210397).

These three zip files, capg-dba.zip, capg-dbb.zip and capg-dbc.zip, contain sEMG data that has been preprocessed. The data in the dba-raw-001.zip is the raw data that has not been segmented, but it is only a small portion or dba. The three papers in the folder are some of study on this data set. A detailed description of the data set can be found in the paper: Surface EMG-Based Inter-Session Gesture Recognition Enhanced by Deep Domain Adaptation.

Thanks to the original author of these paper for sharing this data set. If you have questions about the data in this folder, please feel free to contact [me](https://github.com/TengHuo).
